Nova CS2 - README
Nova CS2 (version 1.0) is a Python-based tool designed to enhance the Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) gaming experience. This README provides guidance on installation, usage, and troubleshooting common issues to ensure smooth operation on Windows systems.
System Requirements

Operating System: Windows (Windows 10/11 requiered).
Python: Version 3.10 or later.
Counter-Strike 2: Must be installed and running.

Installation Guide:
Install Python:

Download and install Python 3.10 or later from python.org.
Ensure pip is included in the installation. After that run the "install.bat" file that is provided in the Installer Folder as the "Run" File


Performance Issues or Crashes:

Cause: High CPU usage, memory access errors, or threading conflicts.
Solution:
Reduce the number of active features (e.g., disable ESP or Radar).
Ensure CS2 is running in a compatible mode (e.g., not Vulkan, if unsupported).
Close unnecessary background applications.
Monitor console output for exceptions and report specific errors.




Additional Notes

Arduino Support: To keep your self safe in the Game we highly recommend getting an Arduino that is fully Undetected! 

CMD Output: The script logs information (e.g., keybind triggers, errors) to the console. Keep the terminal open to monitor for issues.

Stream Proof: Enabling Stream Proof hides the UI and overlay from screen capture (e.g., OBS). Test compatibility with your streaming setup.

Updates: Check for updates to nova.py if new CS2 patches break functionality, as offsets may change.

Support
If you encounter issues not covered here:
Check the console for specific error messages.
Verify all dependencies are up to date.
Report problems with detailed error logs, including Python version, DearPyGui version, and steps to reproduce.
